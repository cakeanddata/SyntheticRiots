# SyntheticRiots
 Synthetic Riot Prediction Dataset & Escalation Model

Overview

This project simulates early warning signs of civil unrest and hate-based violence using synthetic data modeled on real-world dynamics in Northern Ireland. It was built to support community safety, proactive intervention, and policy advocacy ‚Äî especially in environments where access to timely and transparent data is blocked or unsafe to report.

By modeling escalation patterns ‚Äî from hate graffiti to organized riots ‚Äî and incorporating reporting source behavior, this synthetic framework allows us to:
	‚Ä¢	Predict when and where violence may occur
	‚Ä¢	Test intervention strategies (e.g., response times, youth diversion)
	‚Ä¢	Explore reporting bias and data gaps
	‚Ä¢	Generate incident narratives for training or communications

This work is part of a broader anti-riot and community safeguarding initiative supported by NGOs, local political leaders, and grassroots organisations.


Key Features

Escalation Logic

Incidents evolve over time:
	‚Ä¢	Week -4: Graffiti or online abuse
	‚Ä¢	Week -2: Posters, intimidation, suspicious flyers
	‚Ä¢	Week 0: Riot, Molotovs, attacks on homes

Riot onset is influenced by:
	‚Ä¢	Past incident density
	‚Ä¢	Community response strength (e.g., school, housing)
	‚Ä¢	Location risk weighting

"Reported to" Realism

Each incident cintains a likely agencybto whom the incident was reported, based on patterns in the oroginal data:
	‚Ä¢	PSNI: high-severity violence
	‚Ä¢	Schools: graffiti, bullying, unrest among youth
	‚Ä¢	MEARS/Housing: issues inside asylum housing
	‚Ä¢	NGOs or community leaders: lower-severity patterns

This models institutional blind spots and source limitations.

üîç Sample Use Cases
	‚Ä¢	Predicting risk zones prior to major dates (e.g., July 12th marches)
	‚Ä¢	Testing the effectiveness of counter-disinformation campaigns
	‚Ä¢	Training outreach workers or youth mentors on de-escalation patterns
	‚Ä¢	Academic modeling of hate-based violence or state response gaps

Community Safety Context

This project emerged from lived experience in South Belfast, where:
	‚Ä¢	Hate incidents often precede riots by 2‚Äì4 weeks
	‚Ä¢	Marginalized groups report fear but are excluded from emergency meetings
	‚Ä¢	There is no clear, public system for anonymous, multilingual reporting

This dataset and model aim to help NGOs, schools, and local governments prevent violence when official data pipelines fail.

‚∏ª

Collaborators & Support

Developed with support from:
	‚Ä¢	Local elected officials across parties (Green, Alliance, SDLP, DUP)
	‚Ä¢	Community groups like CATU, Donegall Pass Forum, and youth clubs
	‚Ä¢	Unions and rights orgs including NIPSA and Migrants at Work

Open for collaboration with researchers, coders, journalists, and policymakers.

‚∏ª

Ethics & Safety Notes
	‚Ä¢	No real individuals or locations are used ‚Äî all data is synthetic
	‚Ä¢	Intended for training, prediction, and humanitarian use only
	‚Ä¢	For sensitive deployments, consider safeguarding practices and community review
